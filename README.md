CStorm
========
This is based on the wrapper present in the repository https://github.com/filox/StormCpp. Some documentation for the wrapper can be found at
http://demeter.inf.ed.ac.uk/cross/stormcpp.html

I have created a proper example using that wrapper and ported the wrapper to work with Storm 0.10x or higher. 
However, to actually run the example there needs to be a minor modification to the Apache storm sources that I am working on at the moment
and I will update it here once I am done.
